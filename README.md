# Experimental PHP OpenAI Responses Client

This is an **experimental** PHP client for the new **OpenAI Responses API**. It implements the `create`, `find`, and `delete` methods from the API, returning mapped response objects for seamless integration.

The goal of this experimental client is to provide a quick, easy-to-use library that allows you to experiment with the new endpoints from early on.

## Installation
Install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require assistant-engine/php-openai-client
```

## Usage

### Conversation State

```php
use AssistantEngine\OpenAI\Client;

$client = Client::make($_ENV['OPEN_AI_KEY']);

$response = $client->responses()->create([
    'model' => 'gpt-4o',
    'input' => "Can you recommend me what I can eat today?"
]);

print_r($response->getOutputText());

$response2 = $client->responses()->create([
    'model' => 'gpt-4o',
    'previous_response_id' => $response->id,
    'input' => "maybe Pizza?",
]);

print_r($response2->getOutputText());

```

### File Search

```php
use AssistantEngine\OpenAI\Client;

$client = Client::make($_ENV['OPEN_AI_KEY']);

$response = $client->responses()->create([
    'model' => 'gpt-4o',
    'tools' => [
        [
            'type' => 'file_search',
            "vector_store_ids" => ["vs_123456789"]
        ]
    ],
    'input' => "when is the event in berlin happening?"
]);

print_r($response->getOutputText());
```

### Web Search

```php
use AssistantEngine\OpenAI\Client;

$client = Client::make($_ENV['OPEN_AI_KEY']);

$response = $client->responses()->create([
    'model' => 'gpt-4o',
    'tools' => [
        [
            'type' => 'web_search_preview'
        ]
    ],
    'input' => "what was a positive news story from today?"
]);

print_r($response->getOutputText());
```

### Computer Use

```php
use AssistantEngine\OpenAI\Client;

$client = Client::make($_ENV['OPEN_AI_KEY']);

// Path to your image file
$imageFilePath = './path/to/browser_screenshot.png';

// Read the image file contents
$imageData = file_get_contents($imageFilePath);

// Base64 encode the image data
$base64Image = base64_encode($imageData);

$response = $client->responses()->create([
    'model' => 'computer-use-preview',
    'tools' => [
        [
            'type' => 'computer_use_preview',
            "display_width" => 1024,
            "display_height" => 768,
            "environment" => "browser"
        ]
    ],
    'input' => [
        [
            "role" => "user",
            "content" => [
                [
                    "type" => "input_text",
                    "text" => "Can you find me products in sale?"
                ],
                [
                    "type" => "input_image",
                    "image_url" => "data:image/png;base64," . $base64Image
                ]
            ]
        ],

    ],
    "truncation" => "auto"
]);

print_r($response);
```

```php
use AssistantEngine\OpenAI\Client;

$client = Client::make($_ENV['OPEN_AI_KEY']);

$respId = "resp_123456789";
$list = $client->responses()->inputItems()->list($respId);

print_r($list);
```

Please note that this is an experimental client with the purpose to give you a fast possibility to explore the new OpenAI responses API with PHP. Please expect bugs and that not every feature from the new API is implemented.
